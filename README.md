## Why this
Cryptocurrencies are meant to make a change on the way we pay and interchange goods between us. Are made to untie the dependancy between the users (customers) and the centralized entities that are in control (law enforced) of our economy (eg. Banks, FED, etc.).

KYC and AML exchanges are the most common nowadays, they act excactly like a bank. You (usally) don't own any private key, so the funds aren't fully yours. Also they require you to identify yourself (eg. photo of your ID). All of this together goes against the most valuable benefits of cryptocurrencies.

With KYCNOT.ME i want to make it easier for people to buy, exchange and trade cryptos without needing to identify themselves, and preserving the decentralized and self-governed essence of Cryptocurrencies.

### Why only Bitcoin and Monero
Bitcoin because is the biggest, with the most market cap, most adoption and most used among all cryptos. Monero because it is the true digital money, the only one that preserves privacy by design and brings true fungibility.

## Contribute

Contributions are very welcome. Any suggestion, recomendation, correction, idea... Just open a Github issue and I'll fix it as quick as I can.

The webpage is just HTML and CSS, I really try to avoid JavaScript due to all of it's privacy implications so anything related to JS will likely be declined, but you can suggest anyways.

FYI: I'm not a web developer, so don't expect web design to be any great.
